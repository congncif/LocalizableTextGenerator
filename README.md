Your application wants to be popular all over the world. It has to be translated into many different languages. 
That is when localizable text comes. But when working with localizable text, 
you often have to insert the localizable key as plain text into your code. 
When you have a lot of text used it is easy to mess up and it's hard to manage.


*Take a look at the example below*
```swift
  label1.text = "welcome_message".localized
  label2.text = "welcome_title".localized
```

- This, in addition to the aesthetics of code, also makes your code quite difficult to change, for example, 
when you want to change a localizable key, you ***need to search and replace all the key*** in your source code.
- When you want to enter a key, ***Xcode does not automatically complete*** the code for you and it creates a lot of annoyance.

To resolve this, create a `Text.swift` file with structrure:
```swift
struct Text {
    static let welcomeMessage = "welcome_message".localized
    static let welcomeTitle = "welcome_title".localized
}
```
And replace plain localizable key by `Text` values. The new code looks like:
```swift
label1.text = Text.welcomeTitle
label2.text = Text.welcomeMessage
```

Very cool! üôå

But this work is not very good because you have to type localizable keys many times. It takes time and is not fun at all.
You need a tool to solve all of these problems and that is when **Localizable Text Generator** comes.

1. To install, add ```pod 'SiFUtilities/Localize'``` to Podfile. Then run `pod install`.

This command installs Localization feature based on `Localize-Swift` and a tool for generating `Text.swift` file by build pharse scripts named `localizable2appstrings`.

2. On your application targets‚Äô Build Phases settings tab, click the + icon and choose New Run Script Phase. 
Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: /bin/sh), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:
```shell
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
cd "$PROJECT_DIR"

"${PODS_ROOT}"/SiFUtilities/Localize/localizable2appstrings path/to/Localizable.strings path/to/Text.swift

```

3. Press **Command + B** to build your project. The `Text.swift` file is generated automatically.
```swift
/*Generated by localizable2appstrings automatically. Don't change the content of this file!*/

import SiFUtilities
import Foundation

struct Text {
    static let welcomeMessage = "welcome_message".localized
    static let welcomeTitle = "welcome_title".localized
}
```

Awesome üíêüåπ

Now everytime you change the ```Localizable.strings``` file, 
you just press **Command + B** and everything will be automatically synced into the `Text` file for you.

You do not have to worry about `Localizaton` anymore. Happy codingüëè
